# Cloud Native Deployment

Resources for deploying an End-to-End SPA and API code sample to Kubernetes on a development computer.\
The goal is to enable portable code running in a portable deployment setup and with the best capabilities.

## External URLs

Scripts will spin up a number of components for the Final SPA, and these external URLs will be used:

| Component | External URL | Description |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Web Host | https://web.mycompany.com/spa | A development host to serve web static content for the SPA |
| Reverse Proxy | https://api.mycompany.com | The base URL for the reverse proxy that sits in front of APIs |
| Token Handler | https://api.mycompany.com/tokenhandler | The SPA calls the token handler via the reverse proxy to perform OAuth work |
| Business API | https://api.mycompany.com/api | The SPA calls the business API via the reverse proxy to get data |
| Log Query UI | https://logs.mycompany.com/app/dev_tools#/console | The Kibana UI used to analyze technical support logs |

## Prerequisites

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Kubernetes in Docker](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- Configure the Docker Engine to use 16GB of RAM and 4 CPUs
- Also ensure that the `openssl`, `curl` and `jq` tools are installed
- Scripts should be run from either a macOS terminal or from a Windows Git Bash shell

## Deploy the System

First create the cluster:

```bash
./1-create-cluster.sh
```

Then create external SSL certificates and set up a Private PKI for inside the cluster:

```bash
./2-create-certs.sh
```

Then build apps into Docker containers:

```bash
./3-build.sh
```

Then deploy apps to the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
./4-deploy.sh
```

Optionally deploy Elastic Stack components in order to use end-to-end API logging:

```bash
./5-deploy-elasticstack.sh
```

Later you can free all resources when required via this script:

```bash
./6-teardown.sh
```

## Enable Development URLs

Update the hosts file with these development domain names:

```text
127.0.0.1 localhost web.mycompany.com api.mycompany.com
:1        localhost
```

Then trust the root certificate authority at `certs\mycompany.ca.pem`.\
This is done by adding it to the macOS system keychain or Windows local computer certificate store.

## Use the System

Then sign in to the Single Page Application with these details:

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| SPA URL | https://web.mycompany.com/spa |
| User Name | guestuser@mycompany.com |
| User Password | GuestPassword1 |

![SPA](./doc/spa.png)

Also sign into Kibana with these details, and run queries from the [Technical Support Analysis](https://authguidance.com/2019/08/02/intelligent-api-platform-analysis/) blog post:

| Field | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Kibana URL | https://logs.mycompany.com/app/dev_tools#/console |
| User Name | elastic |
| User Password | Password1 |

## View Kubernetes Resources

The deployment aims for a real world setup for a development computer, with multiple worker nodes:

```text
kubectl get nodes:

NAME                  STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
oauth-control-plane   Ready    control-plane,master   15m   v1.21.1
oauth-worker          Ready    <none>                 15m   v1.21.1
oauth-worker2         Ready    <none>                 15m   v1.21.1
```

Each worker node hosts application containers within a `deployed` namespace:

```text
kubectl get pods -o wide -n deployed

NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE

```

Each worker node also hosts Elastic Stack containers within an `elasticstack` namespace:

```text
kubectl get pods -o wide -n elasticstack

NAME                             READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE     IP            NODE
